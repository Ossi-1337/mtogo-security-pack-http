- **gitleaks** – scans repo for committed secrets; fails on findings.
- **trivy_fs** – scans source tree for vulnerable packages/binaries; fails on HIGH/CRITICAL; uploads SARIF.
- **docker_build_scan** – builds the container and scans it with Trivy; fails on HIGH/CRITICAL; uploads SARIF.

## .github/dependabot.yml
